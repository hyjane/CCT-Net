def load(image):
    r"""
    Loads the ``image`` and returns a ndarray with the image's pixel content as well as
    a header object.
    
    The header can, with restrictions, be used to extract additional meta-information
    about the image (e.g. using the methods in `~medpy.io.Header`). Additionally
    it serves as meta-datas container that can be passes to `~medpy.io.save.save` when the
    altered image is saved to the hard drive again. Note that the transfer of meta-datas is
    only possible, and even then not guaranteed, when the source and target image formats
    are the same.
    
    MedPy relies on SimpleITK, which enables the power of ITK for image loading and saving.
    The supported image file formats should include at least the following.

    Medical formats:

    - ITK MetaImage (.mha/.raw, .mhd)
    - Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) (.nia, .nii, .nii.gz, .hdr, .img, .img.gz)
    - Analyze (plain, SPM99, SPM2) (.hdr/.img, .img.gz)
    - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) (.dcm, .dicom)
    - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) series (<directory>/)
    - Nearly Raw Raster Data (Nrrd) (.nrrd, .nhdr) 
    - Medical Imaging NetCDF (MINC) (.mnc, .MNC)
    - Guys Image Processing Lab (GIPL) (.gipl, .gipl.gz)

    Microscopy formats:

    - Medical Research Council (MRC) (.mrc, .rec)
    - Bio-Rad (.pic, .PIC)
    - LSM (Zeiss) microscopy images (.tif, .TIF, .tiff, .TIFF, .lsm, .LSM)
    - Stimulate / Signal Data (SDT) (.sdt)

    Visualization formats:

    - VTK images (.vtk)

    Other formats:
    
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG) (.png, .PNG)
    - Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) (.jpg, .JPG, .jpeg, .JPEG)
    - Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) (.tif, .TIF, .tiff, .TIFF)
    - Windows bitmap (.bmp, .BMP)
    - Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) (.h5 , .hdf5 , .he5)
    - MSX-DOS Screen-x (.ge4, .ge5)
        
    For informations about which image formats, dimensionalities and pixel datas types
    your current configuration supports, run `python3 tests/support.py > myformats.log`.

    Further information see https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io .
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : string
        Path to the image to load.
    
    Returns
    -------
    image_data : ndarray
        The image datas as numpy array with order `x,y,z,c`.
    image_header : Header
        The image metadata as :mod:`medpy.io.Header`.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ImageLoadingError
        If the image could not be loaded due to some reason.
