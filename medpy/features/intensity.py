    A multi-spectral image must be supplied as a list or tuple of its spectra.
    
    Optionally a binary mask can be supplied to select the voxels for which the feature
    should be extracted.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like or list/tuple of array_like 
        A single image or a list/tuple of images (for multi-spectral case).
    mask : array_like
        A binary mask for the image.

def centerdistance(image, voxelspacing = None, mask = slice(None)):
    r"""
    Takes a simple or multi-spectral image and returns its voxel-wise center distance in
    mm. A multi-spectral image must be supplied as a list or tuple of its spectra.
    
    Optionally a binary mask can be supplied to select the voxels for which the feature
    should be extracted.
    
    The center distance is the exact euclidean distance in mm of each voxels center to
    the central point of the overal image volume.
    
    Note that this feature is independent of the actual image content, but depends
    solely on its shape. Therefore always a one-dimensional feature is returned, even if
    a multi-spectral image has been supplied. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like or list/tuple of array_like 
        A single image or a list/tuple of images (for multi-spectral case).
    voxelspacing : sequence of floats
        The side-length of each voxel.
    mask : array_like
        A binary mask for the image.

def centerdistance_xdminus1(image, dim, voxelspacing = None, mask = slice(None)):
    r"""
    Implementation of `centerdistance` that allows to compute sub-volume wise
    centerdistances.
    
    The same notes as for `centerdistance` apply.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like or list/tuple of array_like 
        A single image or a list/tuple of images (for multi-spectral case).
    dim : int or sequence of ints
        The dimension or dimensions along which to cut the image into sub-volumes.
    voxelspacing : sequence of floats

    Returns
    -------
    centerdistance_xdminus1 : ndarray
        The distance of each voxel to the images center in the supplied dimensions.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ArgumentError
        If a invalid dim index of number of dim indices were supplied

    Examples
    --------
    Considering a 3D medical image we want to compute the axial slice-wise
    centerdistances instead of the ones over the complete image volume. Assuming that
    the third image dimension corresponds to the axial axes of the image, we call
        
    >>> centerdistance_xdminus1(image, 2)
    
    Note that the centerdistance of each slice will be equal.

def local_histogram(image, bins=19, rang="image", cutoffp=(0.0, 100.0), size=None, footprint=None, output=None, mode="ignore", origin=0, mask=slice(None)):
    r"""
    Computes multi-dimensional histograms over a region around each voxel.
    
    Supply an image and (optionally) a mask and get the local histogram of local
    neighbourhoods around each voxel. These neighbourhoods are cubic with a sidelength of
    size in voxels or, when a shape instead of an integer is passed to size, of this
    shape.
    
    If not argument is passed to output, the returned array will be of dtype float.
    
    Voxels along the image border are treated as defined by mode. The possible values are
    the same as for scipy.ndimage filter without the ''constant'' mode. Instead "ignore"
    is the default and additional mode, which sets that the area outside of the image are
    ignored when computing the histogram.
    
    When a mask is supplied, the local histogram is extracted only for the voxels where
    the mask is True. But voxels from outside the mask can be incorporated in the
    compuation of the histograms.
    
    The range of the histograms can be set via the rang argument. The 'image' keyword can
    be supplied, to use the same range for all local histograms, extracted from the images
    max and min intensity values. Alternatively, an own range can be supplied in the form
    of a tuple of two numbers. Values outside the range of the histogram are ignored.
    
    Setting a proper range is important, as all voxels that lie outside of the range are
    ignored i.e. do not contribute to the histograms as if they would not exists. Some
    of the local histograms can therefore be constructed from less than the expected
    number of voxels.
    
    Taking the histogram range from the whole image is sensitive to outliers. Supplying
    percentile values to the cutoffp argument, these can be filtered out when computing
    the range. This keyword is ignored if rang is not set to 'image'.
    
    Setting the rang to None causes local ranges to be used i.e. the ranges of the
    histograms are computed only over the local area covered by them and are hence
    not comparable. This behaviour should normally not be taken.
    
    The local histograms are normalized by dividing them through the number of elements
    in the bins.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like or list/tuple of array_like 
        A single image or a list/tuple of images (for multi-spectral case).
    bins : integer
        The number of histogram bins.
    rang : 'image' or tuple of numbers or None
        The range of the histograms, can be supplied manually, set to 'image' to use
        global or set to None to use local ranges.
    cutoffp : tuple of numbers
        The cut-off percentiles to exclude outliers, only processed if ``rang`` is set
        to 'image'.
    size : scalar or tuple of integers
        See footprint, below
    footprint : array
        Either ``size`` or ``footprint`` must be defined. ``size`` gives the shape that
        is taken from the input array, at every element position, to define the input to
        the filter function. ``footprint`` is a boolean array that specifies (implicitly)
        a shape, but also which of the elements within this shape will get passed to the
        filter function. Thus ``size=(n,m)`` is equivalent to
        ``footprint=np.ones((n,m))``. We adjust ``size`` to the number of dimensions of
        the input array, so that, if the input array is shape (10,10,10), and ``size``
        is 2, then the actual size used is (2,2,2).
    output ndarray or dtype
        The ``output`` parameter passes an array in which to store the filter output.
    mode : {'reflect', 'ignore', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'}
        The ``mode`` parameter determines how the array borders are handled. Default is 'ignore'
    origin : number
        The ``origin`` parameter controls the placement of the filter. Default 0.
    mask : array_like
        A binary mask for the image.
        
    Returns
    -------
    local_histogram : ndarray
        The bin values of the local histograms for each voxel as a multi-dimensional image.

    """

def hemispheric_difference(image, sigma_active = 7, sigma_reference = 7, cut_plane = 0, voxelspacing = None, mask = slice(None)):
    r"""
    Computes the hemispheric intensity difference between the brain hemispheres of an brain image.
    
    Cuts the image along the middle of the supplied cut-plane. This results in two
    images, each containing one of the brains hemispheres.
    
    For each of these two, the following steps are applied:
    
    1. One image is marked as active image
    2. The other hemisphere image is marked as reference image
    3. The reference image is fliped along the cut_plane
    4. A gaussian smoothing is applied to the active image with the supplied sigma
    5. A gaussian smoothing is applied to the reference image with the supplied sigma
    6. The reference image is substracted from the active image, resulting in the
       difference image for the active hemisphere
    
    Finally, the two resulting difference images are stitched back together, forming a
    hemispheric difference image of the same size as the original.
    
    Note that the supplied gaussian kernel sizes (sigmas) are sensitive to the images
    voxel spacing.
    
    If the number of slices along the cut-plane is odd, the central slice is
    interpolated from the two hemisphere difference images when stitching them back
    together.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like or list/tuple of array_like 
        A single image or a list/tuple of images (for multi-spectral case).
    sigma_active : number or sequence of numbers
        Standard deviation for Gaussian kernel of the active image. The standard
        deviations of the Gaussian filter are given for each axis as a sequence, or as a
        single number, in which case it is equal for all axes. Note that the voxel
        spacing of the image is taken into account, the given values are treated
        as mm.
    sigma_reference : number or sequence of numbers
        Standard deviation for Gaussian kernel of the reference image. The standard
        deviations of the Gaussian filter are given for each axis as a sequence, or as a
        single number, in which case it is equal for all axes. Note that the voxel
        spacing of the image is taken into account, the given values are treated
        as mm.
    cut_plane : integer
        he axes along which to cut. This is usually the coronal plane.
    voxelspacing : sequence of floats
        The side-length of each voxel.
    mask : array_like
        A binary mask for the image.
        
    Returns
    -------
    hemispheric_difference : ndarray
        The intensity differences between the locally smoothed hemispheres of the image.
        The resulting voxel value's magnitude denotes symmetrical its asymmetry. The
        direction is revealed by the sign. That means that the resulting image will be
        symmetric in absolute values, but differ in sign.
