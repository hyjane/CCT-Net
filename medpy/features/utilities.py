def normalize(vector, cutoffp = (0, 100), model = False):
    r"""
    Returns a feature-wise normalized version of the supplied vector. Normalization is
    achieved to [0,1] over the complete vector using shifting and scaling.
    
    When cut-off percentile (cutoffp) values other than (0, 100) are supplied, the values
    lying before or behind the supplied percentiles are cut-off i.e. shifted to fit the
    range. 
    
    When model is set to True, an additional model describing the normalization is
    returned, that can at a later point be passed to the `normalize_with_model` function
    to normalize other feature vectors accordingly to the one passed.
    
    The vector is expected to have the form samples*features i.e.::
    
            s1    s2    s3    [...]
        f1
        f2
        [...]
    
    Therefore a supplied vector::
    
            s1    s2    s3
        f1   1.5    1    2
        f2    -1    0    1
    
    would result in the returned vector::
    
            s1    s2    s3
        f1 0.50  0.00  1.00
        f2 0.00  0.50  1.00
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vector : sequence
        A sequence of feature vectors to normalize.
    cutoffp : (float, float)
        Cut-off percentiles.
    model : bool
        Whether to return the learned normalization model.
    
    Returns
    -------
    normalized_feature_vectors : ndarray
        The normalized versions of the input vectors.
    model : tuple, optional
        The learned normalization model.

    r"""
    Normalize as with `normalize`, but not based on the datas of the passed feature
    vector, but rather on a learned model created with `normalize`. Thus formerly
    unseen query datas can be normalized according to the training datas.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vector : sequence
        A sequence of feature vectors to normalize.
    model : tuple
        A normalization model created with `normalize`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    normalize : ndarray
        The normalized versions of the input vectors.

def append(*vectors):
    r"""
    Takes an arbitrary number of vectors containing features and append them
    (horizontally).
    
    E.g. taking a 100 and a 200 sample vector with 7 features each, a 300x7
    vector is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *vectors : sequences
        A number of vectors with the same number and type of features.
    
    Returns
    -------
    vector : ndarray
        The appended vectors.

def join(*vectors):

    Takes an arbitrary number of aligned vectors of the same length and combines

    E.g. taking two 100-sample feature vectors of once 5 and once 7 features, a 100x12
