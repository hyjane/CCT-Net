    Splits an integer marker image into two binary image containing the foreground and

    All encountered 1's are hereby treated as foreground, all 2's as background, all 0's

    This behaviour can be changed by supplying the fg_id and/or bg_id parameters.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    marker : ndarray
        The marker image.
    fg_id : integer
        The value that should be treated as foreground.

def graphcut_split(graphcut_function, regions, gradient, foreground, background, minimal_edge_length = 100, overlap = 10, processes = None):
    """
    Executes a graph cut by splitting the original volume into a number of sub-volumes of
    a minimal edge length. These are then processed in subprocesses.
    
    This can be significantly faster than the traditional graph cuts, but should be
    used with, as it can lead to different results. To minimize this effect, the overlap
    parameter allows control over how much the respective sub-volumes should overlap.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    graphcut_function : function
        The graph cut to use (e.g. `graphcut_stawiaski`).
    regions : ndarray
        The regions image / label map.
    gradient : ndarray
        The gradient image.
    foreground : ndarray
        The foreground markers.
    background : ndarray
        The background markers.
    minimal_edge_length : integer
        The minimal edge length of the sub-volumes in voxels.
    overlap : integer
        The overlap (in voxels) between the generated sub-volumes.
    processes : integer or None
        The number of processes to run simultaneously, if not supplied, will be the same
        as the number of processors.
        
    Returns
    -------
