def mkneighbors_graph(observations, n_neighbours, metric, mode='connectivity', metric_params = None):
    """
    Computes the (weighted) graph of mutual k-Neighbors for observations.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The distance between an observation and itself is never computed and instead set to
    ``numpy.inf``. I.e. only in the case of k>=n_observations or when the ``metric``
    returns ``numpy.inf``, the returned graph can contain loops.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    observations : sequence
        Sequence of observations.
    n_neighbours : int
        Maximum number of neighbours for each sample.
    metric : function
        The distance metric taking two observations and returning a numeric value > 0.
    mode : {'connectivity', 'distance', 'both'}, optional
        Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the connectivity matrix with
        ones and zeros, in 'distance' the edges are distances between points, while
        'both' returns a (connectivity, distance) tuple.
    metric_params : dict, optional  (default = None)
            Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.
            
    Returns
    -------
    mkneighbors_graph : ndarray
        Sparse matrix in CSR format, shape = [n_observations, n_observations].
        mkneighbors_graph[i, j] is assigned the weight of edge that connects i to j.
        Might contain ``numpy.inf`` values.

    Notes
    -----
    ``dmeasure`` is assumed to be *symmetry* i.e. between object *a* and object *b* the
    function will be called only ones.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    objects : sequence
        A sequence of objects of length *n*.
    dmeasure : function
        A callable function that takes two objects as input at returns a number.
    diagval : number
        The diagonal values of the resulting array.
        
    Returns
    -------
    pdists : ndarray
        An *nxn* symmetric float array containing the pair-wise distances.
