class IntensityRangeStandardization (object):
    r"""
    Class to standardize intensity ranges between a number of images.
    
    **Short description:**
    Often images containing similar objects or scenes have different intensity ranges
    that make it difficult to compare them manually as well as to process them
    further.
    
    IntensityRangeStandardization offers a way to transform a number of such images
    intensity ranges to a common standard intensity space without any loss of
    information using a multi-segment linear transformation model.
    
    Once learned, this model can be applied to other, formerly unseen images to map
    them to the same standard intensity space.    
            
    **Concept of similar images:**
    IntensityRangeStandardization is limited to similar images. Images containing
    different object or different compositions of objects are not suitable to be
    transformed to a common intensity space (and it would furthermore not make much
    sense).
    
    A typical application of IntensityRangeStandardization are MRI images showing the
    same body region. These often have different intensity ranges, even when acquired
    from the same patient and using the same scanner. For further processing, e.g.
    for training a classifier, they have to be mapped to a common intensity space.
    
    **Failure of the transformation:**
    The method implemented in IntensityRangeStandardization ensures that no
    information is lost i.e. a lossless transformation is performed. This can be
    assured when there exists a one-to-one mapping between the images original
    intensity values and their values mapped to the standard intensity space.
    
    But since the transformation model is trained on, and the standard intensity
    space range selected over the training images, this can not be guaranteed for all
    formerly unseen image. If they differ greatly from the training set images, a
    lossless transformation can not be assured anymore. In this case the transform()
    method will throw an InformationLossException.
    
    Should this happen, the model needs to be re-trained with the original training
    images and additionally the images which caused the failure. Since this will lead
    to a new intensity standard space, all already transformed images have to be
    processed again.
    
    **Setting the training parameters:**
    The method comes with a set of default parameters, that are suitable for most
    cases. But for some special cases, it might be better to set them on your own. Ti
    understand the working of the parameters, it is recommended to read the detailed
    method description first.
    
    **The method depends on three parameters:**
    
    cutoffp, i.e. the cut-off percentiles
        These are used to the define the intensity outliers, both during training and
        image transformation. The default values are usualy a good choice.
        (in [1]_ these are called the minimum and maximum percentile values pc1 and pc2 respectively)
    landmarkp, i.e. the landmark percentiles
        These percentiles define the landmark positions. The more supplied, the more
        exact but less general becomes the model. It is common to supply equally
        spaced percentiles between 0 and 100.
        (in [1]_ these are called the landmark locations mu_1, .., mu_l)
    strange, i.e. the standard intensity space range
        These two intensity values define roughly the standard intensity space (or
        common intensity space of the images; or even target intensity space) to
        which each images intensities are mapped. This space can be supplied, but it
        is usually recommended to let the method select it automatically during the
        training process. It is additionally possible to supply only the lower or
        upper range border and set the other to ''auto'', in which case the method
        chooses the range automatically, but not the position. 
        (in [1]_ these are called the minimum and maximum intensities on the standard scale of the IOI s1 resp. s2)
    
    
    **Details of the method:**
    In the following the method is described in some more detail. For even more
    information see [1]_.
         
    Essentially the method is based on a multi-segment linear transformation model. A
    standard intensity space (or common intensity space) is defined by an intensity
    value range ''stdrange''.
    During the training phase, the intensity values at certain cut-off percentiles of
    each image are computed and a single-segment linear mapping from them to the
    standard intensity space range limits created. Then the images intensity values
    at a number of landmark percentiles are extracted and passed to the linear
    mapping to be transfered roughly to the standard intensity space. The mean of all
    these mapped landmark intensities form the model learned.
      
    When presented with an image to transform, these images intensity values are
    extracted at the cut-off percentile as well as at the landmark percentile
    positions. This results in a number of segments. Using these and the
    corresponding standard intensity space range values and learned mean landmark
    values, a multi-segment linear transformation model is created for the image.
    This is then applied to the images intensity values to map them to the standard
    intensity space.
    
    Outliers, i.e. the images intensity values that lie outside of the cut-off
    percentiles, are treated separately. They are transformed like the first resp.
    last segmented of the transformation model. Not that this means the transformed
    images intensity values do not always lie inside the standard intensity space
    range, but are fitted as best as possible inside.
         
    Parameters
    ----------
    cutoffp : (float, float)
        Lower and upper cut-off percentiles to exclude outliers.
    landmarkp : sequence of floats
        List of percentiles serving as model landmarks, must lie
        between the cutoffp values.
    stdrange : string or (float, float)
        The range of the standard intensity space for which a
        transformation is learned; when set to 'auto, automatically
        determined from the training image upon training; it is also
        possible to fix either the upper or the lower border value and
        setting the other to 'auto'.
        
    Examples
    --------
    We have a number of similar images with varying intensity ranges. To make them
    comparable, we would like to transform them to a common intensity space. Thus we
    run:
    
        >>> from medpy.filter import IntensityRangeStandardization
        >>> irs = IntensityRangeStandardization()
        >>> trained_model, transformed_images = irs.train_transform(images)
        
    Let us assume we now obtain another, new image, that we would like to make
    comparable to the others. As long as it does not differ to much from these, we
    can simply call:
        
        >>> transformed_image = irs.transform(new_image)
        
    For many application, not all images are already available at the time of
    execution. It would therefore be good to be able to preserve a once trained
    model. The solution is to just pickle the once trained model:
    
        >>> import pickle
        >>> with open('my_trained_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        >>>     pickle.dump(irs, f)
            
    And load it again when required with:
    
        >>> with open('my_trained_model.pkl', 'r') as f:
        >>>     irs = pickle.load(f)
